This chapter focuses on correlates of criminal behaviour. Correlates of crime
are variables that are connected with crime. A correlate is “a phenomenon that accompanies another phenomenon and is related in some way to it”
NEL
(Hartnagel 2012). Generations of researchers have examined socio-demographic variables that are correlated with crime. These include offenders’ age, gender, ethno-racial background, and socioeconomic status, as well as the spatial loca-
tion of offences. This chapter explores how these variables or correlates are asso-
ciated with crime. The aim is to answer questions such as these: Who is likely to be involved in crime? How is crime gendered? What does age have to do with criminality? Does race have any relationship with crime?
It is important to understand that correlation is not the same as causation. Thus, while the correlates we will be examining are in some ways connected with criminal behaviour, they do not necessarily cause crime. No single factor explains any particular crime. Each correlate should be viewed as one of a much more complex assortment of factors that contribute to criminal acts. Thus, a change in a correlate of crime may not necessarily lead to a change in crime. Six major cor-
relates of crime are examined in this chapter: age, gender, race, drug and alcohol use, socioeconomic status, and spatial location.

Age as a Correlate of Criminal Behaviour
Young people are disproportionately represented in crime generally and in violent crime in particular. Figure 5.1 shows the age distribution of persons accused of crime in 2011. It illustrates an established pattern: criminal activity intensifies in adolescence and young adulthood and declines thereafter (Hartnagel 2012). The exceptions are political crimes, corruption, and other white-collar crimes; all of these require structural opportunities and employment opportunities that are not yet available to young people. Figure 5.2 shows that persons aged 35 to 89 were responsible for 42 percent of all cases completed in adult criminal court in 2014–15; persons aged 18 to 34 were involved in 58 percent of all cases (Maxwell 2017).
Most crimes committed by Canadian youth are nonviolent (Perreault, 2013). Theft under $5,000 is the most common offence committed by youth (Allen and Superle, 2016). The most common violent crime among Canadian youth is level 1 assault. Level 1 assaults are assaultive acts that do not cause any physical harm to victims. Other violent crimes frequently committed by youth in 2012 were uttering threats, assault level 2, and robbery (Allen and Superle, 2016). Assault level 2 is the category of assaults that involve carrying, using, or threatening to use an imitation or real weapon (Dauvergne, 2009). The 2014 data also show that Canadian youth were heavily involved in crimes such as cannabis possession, administration-of-justice violations, and mischief. Administration-of-justice vio-
lations include failure to report to court, while mischief is the crime of vandalism. It involves unlawful interference with somebody else’s property, thereby causing damage. Most serious youth crimes were down in 2014: there was a 38 percent decrease in youth-perpetrated homicides in 2014, and mischief (–13%) and theft
under $5,000 (–4%) also declined (Boyce, 2015). Only 45 percent of youth accused were formally charged in 2014, a continuation of a trend towards diversion that began in 2003, when the Youth Criminal Justice Act was introduced (Boyce, 2015).
Homicide generally represents less than 1 percent of violent crimes committed by Canadian youth (Taylor-Butts and Bressan 2006), but is worth discussing because of its seriousness. Figure 5.3 shows the percentage of persons of various age categories accused of homicide in 1991 and 2016. Persons aged 12 to 24 committed 32 percent of all homicides in Canada in 2016 and 36 percent of homicides in 1991. In contrast, only 13 percent (2016) and 8 percent (1991) were committed by people aged 50 and above. Persons aged 12 to 24 made up only 16 percent of the Canadian population in 2016 and 14 percent in 1991, while persons aged 50 and above constituted 38 percent of the population in 2016 and 30 percent in 1991 (Statistics Canada, Table 051-0001). Of the 480 persons accused of homicide in 2016, only 22 (4.58%) were youth (aged 12–17) (David 2017). This was nearly 40 percent lower than the number of youth (36 persons) accused of homicide in 2015 (David 2017).
Woodworth, Agar, and Coupland (2013) found that youth homicide offenders were more likely than adults to victimize strangers. They also found that youth are more likely than adults to commit homicides as a group rather than as lone individuals. This suggests that peer influence is a critical factor in youth violence. The rate of violent youth crime in Canada is two to three times lower than the rate among American youth (Li 2008).

Why Do Young People Commit More Crimes than Adults?
Matza (1964) first drew attention to the notion of maturational reform—that there is a reduction in criminal offending as individuals get older. The basic explanation for maturational reform is that adolescence is a period of transition marked by ambiguity. Young people at this stage are neither children nor adults
and may not be fully committed to conventional values. Their infractions, Matza
argues, are temporary. The confusion, marginality, and “in-between-ness” of adolescents’ social position may be conducive to criminal behaviour, for these provide little incentive for noncriminal lifestyles; adults, by contrast, enjoy greater incentives to conform, such as jobs and marriage (Hartnagel 2012). For instance, money is required to participate in the consumerist youth culture of Western societies (Greenberg 1979, cited in Hartnagel 2012). Young people may shoplift or steal if their parents are unable or unwilling to pay for the latest phones and tablets. Hartnagel also suggests that older people may have become more skilled at avoiding detection, and that as they age, they may be physically unable to engage in certain kinds of criminal behaviour.
The notion of maturational reform encompasses three factors that may cause
crime to decline. First, aging brings physiological limitations. Second, the for-
mation of various types of social bonds, such as work, marriage, and children, means that individuals have other people who depend on them to make the “right” choices. Third, maturational reform involves a more socially responsible trajectory of human agency. A relatively simple example of this is that beyond a certain age, “getting wasted” on weekends may no longer sound as attractive a course of individual or group action as it is for younger people.
The notion of maturational reform is intertwined with life course theory. Life course theory is concerned with the “role of age-graded transitions and social con-
trols” (Salvatore and Markowitz 2014, 629). Life course theorists articulate how social bonds (Chapter 14) such as attachment to a spouse, pursuit of education, and
the onset of major life events or turning points such as having children or stable employment help reduce the likelihood of involvement in crime (Salvatore and Markowitz 2014; Laub and Sampson 2001). Laub and Sampson offer a life course theoretical framework for understanding desistance from criminal behaviour. They argue that desistance is an underlying causal process whose end product is reducing or ending involvement in criminal activity. Some of the major factors over the life course that contribute to desistance from crime are “aging; a good marriage; securing legal, stable work; and deciding to ‘go straight,’ including a reorientation of the costs and benefits of crime” (2001, 4). For most individuals, many of these watershed moments take place in adulthood, and they are believed to contribute to reduced criminal offending (Salvatore and Markowitz 2014; Laub and Sampson 2001).
Life course theorists have begun to study the “romance–crime nexus” (Larson and Sweeten 2012, 606). Larson and Sweeten examined the effect of breakup of nonmarital romantic relationships on the offending patterns of 10,438 young people aged 17 to 21 in the United States. They found that male offending increases after the breakup of a nonmarital romantic relationship, but that breakup is not associated with female offending. Also, young people who enter into a new relationship after a breakup avoid engaging in criminal activities but increase their alcohol consumption and illicit drug use.

Gender as a Correlate of Crime
NEL
Have you ever wondered why most criminals are males? This section focuses on
four key questions in the gender distribution of police-reported crime. First, what is the proportion of females accused of crime compared to males? Second,
what are the percentages of females and males under the supervision of correc-
tional services at the provincial and federal levels? Third, what is the gender distribution of convicted persons who have been designated “dangerous offenders” in Canada? And fourth, is there evidence supporting the notion of role convergence between males and females as regards crime? The answers to
these questions provide a gendered picture of criminality.
Females are less likely to be charged with criminal offences. That said, the past three decades have seen an increase in the number of females charged with
criminal involvement—21 percent of adults charged with a Criminal Code offence in 2009 versus 15 percent in 1979 (Mahony 2011b). Despite the increase,
males are still greatly overrepresented in crime. The level of involvement of males
and females varies by type of crime. In 2014–15, for instance, males made up 80 percent of all accused persons in adult criminal courts (Maxwell 2017). Males
were generally more likely than females to be involved in violent and serious offenses (Figure 5.4). Males made up 98 percent of the accused in sexual assault
cases, 89 percent of robbery cases, 86 percent of homicide cases, and 77 percent
of major assault cases. Females were most commonly accused of theft (35%) and
fraud (33%) (Maxwell 2017). Female youth had higher rates of police-reported
crimes than did their older counterparts (Mahony, Jacob, and Hobson 2017).
Gartner, Webster, and Doob (2009, 182) found that women’s imprison-
ment has not increased in the past few decades in Canada despite significant media attention to female crime and a perceived increase in incarceration rates
of women. Figure 5.5 shows that females made up 25 percent of all admissions
to youth correctional services in 2015–16. The pattern is similar among adults. Females made up 8 percent of inmates in sentenced custody at the federal level (which indicates sentences of at least two years), and 7 percent of those admitted to community supervision (Reitano 2017). Male inmates also dominate provin-
cial and territorial prisons. Women constituted only 16 percent of adults admitted to provincial and territorial prisons in 2015–16 (Reitano 2017). Adult female sentences were generally shorter those given to male counterparts.
Why do women receive more lenient treatment in the courts? The main reason is that males commit more serious crimes, especially more violent offences. A second factor that influences court decisions is female offenders’ responsibility for young children (Kruttschnitt 2013).

Women and Violent Crime
As shown in Figure 5.6, 86 percent of persons accused of homicide in 2016 were male (Statistics Canada 2017a). This is down slightly from 89 percent in 2012 (Boyce and Cotter 2013). Most homicide victims are male (75%) (Figure 5.7).
The category “dangerous offender” sheds light on those considered most violent among the population convicted of serious crime. Canada’s dangerous offender law (section 753 of the Criminal Code) separates out the most aggressive crim-
inal recidivists among those who have been convicted of a violent and/or sexual criminal offence. A person who has been classified as a dangerous offender can be held in prison for an indeterminate period. Of nearly 500 persons held in 2013 under the “dangerous offender” law, only one was a woman.
Both males and females are more likely to be killed by males. Females are more than twice as likely as males to be killed by their spouse (Mahony 2011a; Ansara and Hindin 2010). When a woman commits a violent crime, it is often against someone closely related to her. Victims of female acts of violence in 2015 were the spouse or some other intimate partner (36%), an acquaintance (35%), a stranger (12%), or a family member (17%) (Mahony, Jacob, and Hobson 2017). Males are more likely to direct their violence at acquaintances, especially when the crime is homicide.
Heimer and De Coster (1999) have made an important contribution to our understanding of the gender gap in violent crime by examining structural posi-
tions and cultural processes, including social learning. They conclude that:
larceny, burglary,

lent crime have produced fairly consistent results. The most violent males are those who are the most disadvantaged. Steffensmeier and Haynie (2000, 428) found that structural disadvantage variables (poverty, income inequality, a female-headed home, etc.) were also associated with female violent crimes. More specifically, they found that structural disadvantage had “significant effects” on robbery and homicide and modest effects on the rates of and aggravated assault committed by women. Even so, structural disadvantage has a greater impact on male than on female criminal  behaviour. Marriage has
1.  Violent delinquency is a function of the social learning of violent definitions
of appropriate behaviour by both males and females.
2.  There are gender differences in the process of learning violent definitions.
Direct parental controls such as aggressive discipline influence violent defini-
tions for males to a greater degree than for females, while indirect parental
controls, such as emotional attachment to family, influence girls’ learning of
violent definitions but not boys’.
3.  Direct parental controls such as supervision of the youth’s friendships help
reduce violent delinquency in boys but have no importance for violence com-
mitted by girls.
4.  Girls who accept traditional gender definitions have lower rates of violence;
such ideational notions have no influence on violence by boys.
5.  Violence by boys and girls is shaped by position in the social structure, but
the influence of position in the social structure over criminal behaviour in
boys and girls differs.
6.  Boys have higher rates of violent delinquency partly because they tend to
learn more violent definitions and gender definitions and have greater expe-
rience with violent crime than girls.
7.  Boys tend to learn more violent definitions than girls because of their experi-
ence with violence and lower levels of emotional attachment to their families.
