alcohol misuse, socio-economic status, and spatial location.


In all societies, younger people commit more crime than older people. Most
types of crime peak during the teen years and decline steadily thereafter.
However, the peak is later for some types of violent offences and for white-
collar and corporate crimes.                    


Women commit less crime than men, particularly for serious and violent
offences. While females have increased their level of involvement in crime
since the 1960s, most of this increase has been for minor offences such a
shoplifting and low-level fraud, which many researchers believe ref lects the
feminization of poverty over that period of time.


In most countries, there are racial and ethnic differences in crime. These dif-
ferences are due to some combination of differential offending and differen-
tial treatment by the justice system. Criminologists have developed a number
of theories to explain differential offending by minority groups, including
these: cultural theories, the colonial model, trauma transmission model, and
critical race theory.


Drugs and alcohol are major contributors to crime. There are three factors
linking drug and alcohol use and crime: efforts to support addictions can lead
to involvement in crimes; an individual may commit crimes because they are
under the inf luence of drugs or alcohol; and the possession of illegal drugs in
and of itself is a crime.


The linkage between socioeconomic status and crime is complex and varies
by type of crime. The best evidence suggests that violent crimes and many
other types of street crime are disproportionately committed by people from
the lower classes, while upper-class people are disproportionately involved in
serious forms of white-collar and corporate crimes.


Different countries, provinces, cities, and neighbourhoods have very dif-
ferent rates of crime. There are a variety of different explanations for these
differences.
